        <!-- SECTION 1 -->
        <section class="section-card">
            <div class="section-header">
                <div class="section-icon">📋</div>
                <h2>1. Purpose and Status of These Guidelines</h2>
            </div>
            <p>These Community Guidelines ("Guidelines") set out the standards of conduct that all users of the Humrah platform are required to follow as a condition of access. They form part of the Terms of Service and should be read alongside the Privacy Policy.</p>
            <p>Humrah operates as an intermediary technology platform under Section 79 of the Information Technology Act, 2000 and the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021. Humrah's role is to provide a platform through which registered adult users may discover each other and arrange voluntary, peer-to-peer in-person meetups at public locations.</p>

            <div class="emphasis-box">
                <p><strong>What Humrah Does and Does Not Do:</strong> Humrah provides a communication and coordination platform. Humrah does not arrange, supervise, direct, or attend any offline meeting between users. Humrah does not employ, represent, or act as agent for any user. Humrah cannot monitor or control user conduct during offline interactions. Users are entirely responsible for their own conduct and safety during any meetup arranged through the platform.</p>
            </div>

            <p>These Guidelines describe prohibited conduct on the platform and explain Humrah's moderation approach. Humrah's ability to take moderation action is limited to platform-level measures — such as content removal, account restriction, and account termination. Humrah has no ability to intervene in offline conduct and does not represent that these Guidelines can prevent harm occurring outside the platform environment.</p>
            <p>Humrah is not a dating application, escort service, or adult entertainment platform. Users must not use the platform for any purpose inconsistent with lawful social companionship at public locations.</p>

            <div class="warning-box">
                <span class="warning-icon">⚠️</span>
                <div>
                    <p><strong>Age Requirement:</strong> Use of Humrah is restricted to individuals who are 18 years of age or older. By registering on Humrah, you declare that you meet this age requirement. This declaration is your responsibility. Humrah does not use face verification to determine age; face verification is used solely for duplicate account detection.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>Users who do not meet the age requirement are prohibited from accessing or using the platform. Where Humrah receives a credible report or discovers evidence that a user is under the age of 18, Humrah may suspend the account pending review and, following verification, will terminate the account and delete associated data in accordance with the Privacy Policy.</p>
            <p>Users must also have the legal capacity to enter into a binding contract under Indian law and must not be subject to any legal restriction that would prohibit use of this type of platform.</p>

                <h2>3. Offline Meetings: User Responsibility and Platform Limitations</h2>
            </div>

            <div class="emphasis-box public-meetups">
                <p><strong>Platform Limitation Notice:</strong> Humrah facilitates communication between users and provides a booking tool for users to coordinate meetups. Humrah does not select, approve, or monitor meeting locations. Users independently choose where and whether to meet. Humrah cannot verify that any meetup actually occurs in a public location, and does not supervise or attend any offline meeting.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>User Obligation Regarding Meeting Locations</h3>
            <p>Users must not use the Humrah platform to arrange or propose meetups in private residential locations, non-public spaces, or any setting that would place another user at an unreasonable risk. Using the platform to propose or arrange meetings in private locations is a violation of these Guidelines and may result in account enforcement action.</p>
            <p>This obligation applies to conduct on the platform — meaning what users propose and communicate through the application. Humrah cannot enforce or monitor what occurs in person and does not represent that it can do so.</p>

            <h3>Safety Recommendations (Not Obligations)</h3>
            <p>The following are recommended safety practices. They are provided for informational purposes only and do not constitute obligations on Humrah's part, nor do they create any duty of care on Humrah's part toward users who do or do not follow them:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Meet only in well-lit, populated public spaces.</li>
                <li>Inform a trusted contact of the meetup details — time, location, and the identity of the person you are meeting — before attending.</li>
                <li>Trust your own judgment and leave any situation that does not feel safe.</li>
                <li>In the event of an emergency, contact the relevant emergency services (such as the police) directly. Humrah is not an emergency response service.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- SECTION 4 -->
        <section class="section-card">

                <div class="section-icon">🤝</div>
                <h2>4. Conduct Standards: Respect and Non-Harassment</h2>
            </div>
            <p>Users are required to conduct themselves with basic respect and courtesy toward other users, both on the platform and during any offline interaction arising from use of the platform.</p>
            <p>The following conduct is prohibited on the platform and constitutes a violation of these Guidelines. Where such conduct is also reported to have occurred offline, Humrah may take account-level action and may refer the matter to law enforcement where appropriate:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Sending unsolicited sexual messages, content, or images to another user.</li>
                <li>Continuing to contact a user after they have declined interaction or blocked the sender.</li>
                <li>Using offensive, degrading, abusive, or threatening language in communications through the platform.</li>
                <li>Engaging in conduct designed to intimidate, stalk, or coerce another user through the platform.</li>
                <li>Sending explicit, sexual, or inappropriate visual content through the in-app messaging system.</li>
                <li>Making comments that demean another user based on appearance, body, or personal characteristics.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Humrah moderates the platform environment. Humrah does not represent that these standards can be enforced in relation to conduct that occurs entirely outside the platform, and is not liable for conduct that occurs offline between users.</p>

                    <p><strong>Priority Enforcement:</strong> The following categories of conduct are treated as serious violations. Where a credible report or evidence of such conduct is received, Humrah may take immediate account-level enforcement action — including suspension or termination — without following a graduated warning process, and may refer the matter to law enforcement. Enforcement decisions in these cases remain discretionary and based on the information available to Humrah at the time of review.</p>

            </div>
            <p>Humrah's face verification system is a security mechanism intended to reduce fraudulent and duplicate account creation. It is not a guarantee of identity. Users must not attempt to circumvent, manipulate, or misuse the verification process. The following conduct is prohibited:</p>

                <li>Submitting a verification video of a person other than yourself.</li>

                <li>Blackmail, extortion, or coercion of another user using information disclosed in private communications.</li>

                <li>Sharing intimate or confidential information disclosed by another user in private communications without that user's consent.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The sharing or screenshotting of communications is not itself prohibited. The prohibition concerns the use of such content to harm, coerce, or exploit another user. Users should exercise their own judgment about what personal information they disclose in in-app communications.</p>

            </div>
            <p>Users are responsible for ensuring that their profile content does not materially deceive other users about who they are. The following conduct is prohibited:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Using profile photographs that do not represent your own current appearance and are intended to deceive other users about your identity.</li>
                <li>Misrepresenting your age in a way that affects another user's decision to interact with you, or that conceals that you do not meet the minimum age requirement.</li>
                <li>Materially misrepresenting your location in a way that causes another user to believe you are available for local meetups when you are not.</li>
                <li>Stating interests or activities in your profile that are fabricated for the purpose of deceiving other users into agreeing to a meetup.</li>

                <h2>15. Reporting Process and Notice-and-Action</h2>
            </div>
            <p>Humrah operates a notice-and-action moderation process. Users may submit reports of suspected violations of these Guidelines through the in-app reporting feature available on any user profile or within any booking or chat screen. Users may also contact Humrah's safety team at safety@humrah.in for urgent concerns.</p>

            <h3>What Happens After a Report is Submitted</h3>
            <p>When a report is received, Humrah's moderation team will:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Acknowledge receipt of the report where a response mechanism is available.</li>
                <li>Review the reported content or account in accordance with these Guidelines and the Terms of Service.</li>
                <li>Take action proportionate to the severity of the violation and the evidence available, which may include content removal, account restriction, account suspension, or permanent termination.</li>
                <li>Where required by law, preserve relevant data and cooperate with law enforcement.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Humrah does not guarantee a specific outcome for any report. Moderation decisions are made at Humrah's discretion based on the information available at the time of review. Humrah is not obligated to provide reasons for every moderation decision to the reporting user.</p>

            <h3>Good Faith Reporting Protection</h3>
            <p>Users who submit reports in good faith — meaning reports based on a genuine and reasonable belief that a violation has occurred — will not face account enforcement action solely for having submitted the report, regardless of the outcome of the review.</p>
            <p>Submitting false, fabricated, or deliberately misleading reports for the purpose of harassing or causing harm to another user is itself a violation of these Guidelines and may result in enforcement action against the reporting user.</p>

            <h3>Emergency Situations</h3>
            <p>Humrah is not an emergency response service. If you are in immediate danger or are aware of an immediate risk to another person's safety, contact the relevant emergency services (such as the police) directly. Reporting through the Humrah app is not a substitute for contacting emergency services.</p>

                <h2>16. Moderation and Enforcement</h2>
            </div>
            <p>Humrah's moderation team reviews reports and takes enforcement action at its discretion. Enforcement actions are proportionate to the nature and severity of the violation, the user's account history, and the evidence available to the moderation team at the time of review. Humrah does not guarantee identical outcomes across similar cases, as each case is assessed individually.</p>

            <h3>Range of Enforcement Actions</h3>
            <p>Depending on the circumstances, Humrah may take one or more of the following actions:</p>

            <h3>Content Removal</h3>
            <p>Specific content — such as a profile photo, message, or review — may be removed from the platform where it is found to violate these Guidelines or applicable law. Content removal does not necessarily result in account suspension.</p>

            <h3>Formal Warning</h3>
            <p>A notice may be issued to a user in relation to a minor or first-instance violation. The account remains active but is noted for monitoring purposes.</p>

            <h3>Feature Restriction</h3>
            <p>Access to specific features — such as messaging, booking creation, or profile visibility — may be restricted temporarily while a complaint is under review or as a standalone enforcement measure for a moderate violation.</p>

            <h3>Temporary Suspension</h3>
            <p>Full account access may be temporarily revoked for a defined period where the violation warrants a suspension but not permanent removal. The duration is at Humrah's discretion and will reflect the severity of the conduct.</p>

            <h3>Permanent Termination</h3>
            <p>An account may be permanently terminated where: (a) a serious violation is confirmed; (b) a user has accumulated repeated violations over time; or (c) an immediate risk to user safety is identified. Permanent termination prevents re-registration using the same identity and device where technically feasible.</p>

            <h3>Immediate Action in Serious Cases</h3>
            <p>In cases involving serious violations — including those listed in Section 5 — Humrah may take immediate enforcement action, up to and including permanent termination, without following a graduated process. The availability of immediate action is a discretionary tool; it does not mean that Humrah guarantees to take immediate action in every serious case, as moderation decisions depend on the information available at the time of review.</p>

            <div class="emphasis-box">
                <p><strong>No Guarantee of Outcome:</strong> These enforcement tools represent the range of actions available to Humrah's moderation team. Humrah does not guarantee that any specific violation will result in a specific enforcement action, or that all violations will be detected and actioned. The effectiveness of moderation depends on users reporting violations and on the information made available to the moderation team.</p>

            </div>
            <p>Users who believe that an enforcement action taken against their account — including content removal, feature restriction, suspension, or termination — was made in error may submit an appeal. Appeals must be submitted within 30 days of the enforcement action being communicated to the user.</p>

            <h3>How to Submit an Appeal</h3>
            <p>Send an email to appeals@humrah.in from your registered email address with the following information:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your registered email address and account identifier (if known).</li>
                <li>A description of the enforcement action you are appealing.</li>
                <li>A clear explanation of why you believe the action was made in error.</li>
                <li>Any supporting evidence or context you wish the moderation team to consider.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Appeal Review Process</h3>
            <p>Appeals are reviewed by a member of the moderation team who was not involved in the original decision, where practicable. Humrah will respond to appeals within 15 business days of receiving a complete submission. During the appeal period, the enforcement action remains in place unless Humrah determines that an interim reversal is appropriate.</p>
            <p>Humrah reviews appeals in good faith but retains full discretion in determining the outcome. The outcome of a completed appeal is final within the Humrah platform. This does not affect any right a user may have to seek redress through the Grievance Officer (as described in the Privacy Policy) or through applicable legal processes.</p>

                <li>Where required by applicable law or regulation.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Humrah does not share user data with law enforcement or regulatory authorities on the basis of informal requests. Requests must be in writing and issued by a competent authority with legal authority to require disclosure. The Privacy Policy describes in more detail how user data is handled in relation to legal requests.</p>

            <h3>Evidence Preservation</h3>
            <p>Where a complaint or report suggests potential criminal conduct, or where Humrah receives a lawful request from a competent authority, Humrah may preserve relevant account data, communications, and records beyond the standard retention periods described in the Privacy Policy, for the duration required by the applicable legal obligation. Users whose data is preserved will be informed of this where notification is permitted by applicable law.</p>

                <h2>Summary of Key Legal Revisions (For Internal Reference)</h2>
            </div>
            <p style="color: var(--text-secondary);">The following liability exposures and legal deficiencies were identified and corrected in this revised document:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Rewrote the purpose section (Section 1) to lead with an explicit intermediary status declaration under the IT Act, 2000, making it the structural foundation of the document rather than an afterthought in a liability disclaimer section at the end.</li>
                <li>Removed the claim that Humrah "verifies age through documentation" — no such process exists. Replaced with a declaration-based age confirmation model consistent with the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.</li>
                <li>Rewrote the public meetups section (Section 3) to remove the implication that Humrah can ensure or enforce that meetings occur in public. Reframed as a user obligation on the platform, with explicit acknowledgment of Humrah's monitoring limitation. Safety advice is explicitly framed as recommendations, not platform obligations, to avoid creating a duty-of-care argument.</li>
                <li>Replaced "zero tolerance — will result in immediate account termination" language (Section 5) with discretionary priority enforcement wording. The original absolute guarantee creates an actionable obligation that Humrah cannot consistently fulfil. The revised language preserves the ability to act immediately while making clear that all enforcement is discretionary and evidence-dependent.</li>
                <li>Added a formal notice-and-action process (Section 15) in compliance with IT Intermediary Guidelines Rules, 2021, including acknowledgment timelines, proportionality principle, and a clear statement of what is not guaranteed.</li>
                <li>Added good faith reporting protection (Section 15) and separated it from the prohibition on malicious false reporting, which is now itself a guideline violation.</li>
                <li>Converted enforcement language (Section 16) from prescriptive outcome guarantees to a discretionary range of available actions with a clear "no guarantee" notice. This prevents users relying on these Guidelines as a binding commitment to specific outcomes.</li>
                <li>Added a "no guarantee of outcome" disclaimer to enforcement section and clarified that moderation effectiveness depends on user reports and available information.</li>
                <li>Removed the strict real name requirement (Section 10) and replaced it with an impersonation prohibition. A strict real name requirement conflicts with privacy law principles, is unenforceable in practice, and may deter legitimate users. The revised standard focuses on deceptive conduct rather than documentary identity.</li>
                <li>Rewrote the screenshot/recording prohibition (Section 12) to remove an overbroad ban on all recording of communications (which is unenforceable and may conflict with users' rights to preserve evidence of harassment). The revised section focuses only on the harmful use of such content.</li>
                <li>Rewrote the law enforcement cooperation section (Section 18) to limit cooperation to lawful written requests from competent authorities. The original wording created a blanket cooperation commitment with no procedural constraints, risking both user trust and potential DPDP Act compliance issues.</li>
                <li>Added an evidence preservation provision (Section 18) consistent with the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy, with user notification where legally permitted.</li>
                <li>Relocated and strengthened the intermediary liability notice (Section 19), integrating it as a substantive user acknowledgment rather than a brief disclaimer. Ensured all intermediary limitation language is consistent with the Terms of Service.</li>
                <li>Added the Grievance Officer contact (grievance@humrah.in) to the contact section for consistency with DPDP Act obligations referenced in the Privacy Policy.</li>
                <li>Removed marketing and emotional language throughout, including the tagline "Keeping Humrah safe, respectful, and real" which implied a platform guarantee of those outcomes.</li>
            </ul>
